# Todo-List

Welcome to my second React project! This is a todo list application where tasks are saved in a database. 

## Functionality
1. Change the status of tasks
2. Create new tasks
 

## How to run the project locally on your machine

1. **Download Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the Server**: Open the integrated terminal in the server folder and type:
    ```bash
    node server
    ```

3. **Run the Client**: Open the integrated terminal in the client folder and type:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```


## Notes
- The server I used is SoftUni's practice server, not mine.
